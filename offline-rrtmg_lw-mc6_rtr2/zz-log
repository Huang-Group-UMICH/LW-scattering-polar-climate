	1. MODIFY input/output of subroutine *inatm* and *rrtmg_lw* to include TAMU-needed cloud ice optical variables, ssacmc & xmommc
	2. Test ok

	x. ONGOING work
		a. modify rrtmg_lw_rtr2function.f90 to take cloud variables at g-point dimension

2017/03/02
	1. MOVE TAMU's subroutine *rtr2function* into rrtmg_lw_rtrnmc.f90 so that CESM dosen't complie extra file.
	2. MODIFY the dimensions of cloud varaibles of rtr2function to match those used in RRTMG_LW, i.e. (nlay,ig) to (ig,nlay)
	3. TEST of rtr2function for MLS with a single-layer cloud is done.

	x. ONGOING work
		a. clean modified codes and then test within CESM
		b. MODIFY mcica to generate SSA, ASY subcolumns in CESM

	1. ADD logical variable to control whether applying cloud LW scattering in rrtmg_lw_rad.f90

	1. FOUND that clear-sky flux difference between tamu and default is ~ 2 W/m2 at the TOA.

	1. If there is a temperature at the surface (i.e. surface temperature is less than the lowermost atmosphere), 
	   downward flux by TAMU and default RRTMG are quite different (downward 3 Wm-2 diff).

	1. Replace rtr2func by the original and updated one by Chia-Pang, insensitiveness of surface temperature is still there.
	   So, it is NOT due to my modication for dimension of cloud variables.
	       it is NOT due to fortran compiler. (now I use Intel as Chia-Pang)
	   So, how to find out the reason?
	     a. use the exactly same input fields as the column mode

	1. Using the MLS profile from the RRTMG column mode, the Two Function shows the sensitivity of surface temperatures.
	   The result is almost identical to the column mode of Two Function.
	   So, some issues in the Chou MLS profile lead to the error the Two function.

2017/06/07
	1. Confirm that the discrepancy of different surface temperature between TwoFunction and Default is due to Chou MLS profile.
	   I inserted the Chou MLS profile into the column mode of RRTMG, the cooling rate at the lowermost layer is not changed in different surface temp.

2017/06/11
	1. Closely review RRTMG column mode with MLS 75 profiel again. This time, the column mode shows that the cooling rate at the lowermost layer does change with different surface temp.
	   It contradicts with my note on 06/07. I think I made some mistakes on June 7.
	   So, there is no any problem regarding the RRTMG column mode with 75 and 71 MLS profile. But I can make sure with Chia-Pang that we are on the same page.
	2. I use two ways to read MLS 75 profile: one is used read-in T,P,... profile, which is as the same as my ordinary tests, and the other is used read-in AFTER inatm profile, which is as the same as 71 MLS.
           These two ways generate different heating rate profile. The former shows independency to surface temps while the latter shows dependency, as the same as column mode of RRTMG.
	3. I think the read-in atm profile is wrong. In order to change surface temperature, both surface temp (line #5) and that on the first column of level temperature (line #4) must be changed. I only changed line #5 recently, so I got different results.
